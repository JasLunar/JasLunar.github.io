### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

   Lab 7 part 1 "Parking Rules" was one of the more engaging assignments because it required a practical implementation of programming into everyday real-world scenarios. I was able to use tracing techniques and the logic of negations and conditional statements involving comparison operations, and/or, and sequences to provide an output that corroborates with the logic of parking rules. I learned how to translate specific details and compounding conditions into coed that produces a clear answer using if condition statements and Boolean functions.  

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 2 "Pattern with Loops" used three loops to create a pattern in the program output and was one of my favorite assignments because it dealt with manipulating loops and iterations to produce a fun output. I was able to better grasp the concept of nested for loops and how and where to use constant variables. I also learned the importance of ensuring a loop increments/decrements to a known end as to avoid an infinite pattern.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 part 1 "Spelling Checker" had one of the more interesting assignments prompts because it involved reading input from a file, using a function to check each word, and creating a vector containing misspelled words. I was able to use a while loop to read input from a file and added it to a vector using the push back function. I also learned how to implement a for each loop to iterate through a vector of strings and print output to the terminal.
